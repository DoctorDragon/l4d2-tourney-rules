to a counterpart if possible.

#####1.5 Official communication
Official communication will take place via [the official cup group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eqcup2) and [forum on L4Dnation.com](http://www.l4dnation.com/community-news/eq-nations-world-cup-2014/).

#####1.6 Changes
The tournament directors reserve the right to make any changes or updates deemed necessary regarding anything to do with the tournament.

#####1.7 Server bans
The tournament directors do not have the authority to demand server admins rescind player bans on their servers if a banned player is trying to play a match. It is to the server admin's discretion whether the player's ban may be temporarily rescinded.

##Section 2: Tournament format, standings, and tiebreaks

#####2.1 Format
This will be a Swiss System tournament. A match win will
score 1 point; a tie scores a half point; a loss or forfeit scores 0
points. After the opening phase has been completed, the final knockout phase will commence.

######2.1.1 Pairings
After the registration deadline, the registered participants will be
paired together in the 1st round according to which continental community they belong to. In subsequent rounds, partcipants will be paired at random against others with the same record of Won : Lost games.

######2.1.2 Double jeopardy
Under no circumstances will two competitors face each other more than
once during the primary phase of the tournament.

######2.1.3 Awarding a bye
In the event that a round must be paired with an uneven number of
participants, a bye will be awarded to the lowest ranked participant in
the lowest score group. A bye scores a full point.

######2.1.4 Tiebreakers
Ties will be broken by the following criteria, descending (see [Buchholz-Median 
tiebreak](http://www.swissperfect.com/tiebreak.htm#buchholz), also known as "Modified Median"):

1. The sum of conventional scores of the teams each participant has
defeated, excluding the lowest and highest (higher is better).
2. The result of the head-to-head matchup of the tied participants, if
applicable.

######2.1.5 More information
For information on the Swiss System, you can review the following
links:

* [Wizards of the Coast](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Swiss_Pairings.pdf)

If you have any further questions about the Swiss System, contact a
Tournament Director or the author.

#####2.2 Deadlines
Because the pairings are based on prior round scoring, the next round
cannot be paired until all the results of the previous round have been
reported.

Unless teams make the effort to communicate with the admins to explain any potential difficulties within reasonable time of the deadline, there will be a *ZERO TOLERANCE* policy for matches that
remain unscheduled or unreported past the round deadline.

#####2.3 Maps
- Dead Center
- Dark Carnival
- Swamp Fever
- Hard Rain
- The Parish
- Carried Off
- Warcelona
- Fall in Death

All listed custom campaigns can be downloaded [here.](http://31.186.250.11/addons/)

######2.3.2 Finales
Finales are optional; it is the choice of the home team to decide if finales are played. The only exception to this rule is on Dead Center and custom campaigns where it is mandatory to play finales.

##Section 3: Team registration

#####3.1 Registration

#####3.3 Double registration
Competitors may be registered for only one team in the tournament. A
competitor who drops from a roster must explain to the tournament directors why they have left the team and wish to play for a different one. The player must gain admin approval and be aiming for a team with less than the maximum limit of 6 players, before being cleared to join a new team. Changing teams is disallowed for any player who belongs to a team that has already been knocked out of the competition.

##Section 4: Servers
Game servers will be selected according to the following criteria:

#####4.1.1 Hosting
Servers must be chosen from the official server list.

#####4.2 Configuration
The server will have an up-to-date and working installation of the EQ 2.1
configuration and plugins.

#####4.3 Web-cast support

#####4.5 DOS protection
Servers with [DoS Protection](https://github.com/SirPlease/IPTables) are preferred.

#####4.6.1 International draws

#####4.6.2 !cup command
It is mandatory in home and away matches to use the !cup command to enforce boss spawn consistency in an international round draw. However, the !cup command is optional in neutral matches, but still recommended on the basis of ensuring intuitive boss spawns.

##Section 5: Match scheduling and match rules

#####5.1 Rounds and scheduling
Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.

at [doodle.com](http://doodle.com): it is free, functional, does not
require registration, and supports time zones.

Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule early; delinquent
scheduling must be brought to the attention of the staff before the
deadline.

Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.

#####5.2 Tardiness
Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in
the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a
forfeit loss of the match.

Each team is permitted one (1) 10-minute break per match, and only
between rounds. Extra breaks require the consent of both the other
team, and the admins or casters.

#####5.3 Casting

process. Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

#####5.4 Spectators and admins

######5.4.1 Requests for Oversight
Any team may request that an admin be present at their match. The staff
will honour reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing
conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament
results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper behaviourr that
may take place.

######5.4.2 Spectators
Aside from staff and authorized casters, no spectators whatsoever will
be allowed in the server during matches.

#####5.5 Ringers

#####5.5.1 Conditions
Ringers are allowed, so long as they are not registered with another competing team. A player who has already been called as a ringer for another team, may only ring if the opposing team is fine with it.

No registered competitor may ring for another team unless their team has
withdrawn from the tournament or they have been removed from the roster.

#####5.6 Pauses

######5.6.1 Excessive pausing
Intentionally affecting the result of the round through excessive
pausing may be brought to the attention of the tournament directors.

The penalty for abuse of the pause function can range from a points penalty to a more severe form of punishment.

#####5.7 Screenshots and demos

######5.7.1 Demos are mandatory
Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match
play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and
must be submitted promptly to a tournament director on request.

######5.7.2 How-to record demos
To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`.  It is
not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to
re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

######5.7.3 Screenshots are mandatory
Each team is allowed up to one (1) pause per round to request
screenshots.

Each competitor must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the
server.

######5.7.4 Privacy
Competitors are never required to provide demos or screenshots to anyone
except the staff. Although there is no basis for an expectation of
privacy, they are considered confidential and will be shared only for:

- Asking second opinions of skilled players who are trusted to keep what
  they find in confidence
- To expose wrongdoing to the community if, and only if, it is discovered

######5.7.5 Responsibility is with you
It is each competitor’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos
and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted in a timely
manner.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff will
result at minimum in a zero score for the associated rounds, and
possible suspension of the player from the tournament.

#####5.8 Illegal techniques

######5.8.1 AI pathing exploits
It is illegal to intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area
that causes NPC infected to stop attacking. This includes re-entering the
safe-room and standing behind a dynamic prop that the witch cannot
navigate around. However, is permitted to exploit witch pathing in a way
that causes her to climb over objects repeatedly.

The minimum penalty for intentionally exploiting AI pathing will be 500 points deducted.

######5.8.2 Tank parking
If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be
notified in a reasonable time. Intentionally positioning a tank so that
it cannot advance when AI controlled is not allowed.

The minimum penalty for intentional tank parking will be 500 points deducted at the time of the infraction.

######5.8.3 Spectating
Players may spectate if and only if they have unintentionally become
stuck in a clip brush or other entity and cannot move.

The minimum penalty for abuse of the spectate command will be a penalty of 200 points. The maximum penalty will be decided by the tournament directors if deemed necessary.

#####5.9 Glitches

######5.9.1 Rescue vehicles
In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp
Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will
be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final scores
will be calculated manually.

######5.9.2 Unclearable survivors
If a pinned survivor is unclearable after an infected player gains
control of the tank, either team can request that the round be
replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and
determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some
other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

##Section 6: Addons and configuration
The following guidelines will assist the competitors in understanding
the intentions of the tournament directors. However, the tournament
directors may choose to sanction competitors for any addons or
modifications at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).

All competitors are urged strongly to discuss any modifications with

with a stock configuration.
